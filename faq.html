    <a name="general2"></a><b>What are Arthur and MOBIUS?</b><br />

MOBIUS is a group (consortium) of over sixty libraries throughout the state of Missouri that shares resources so patrons may borrow books not owned by their local library.  <br />

    <br />

Arthur is a cluster or group of Missouri libraries, within the MOBIUS library consortium. It consists of six libraries in the central Missouri area: Columbia College, Lincoln University, the Missouri State Library, Stephens College, Westminster College, and William Woods University. The Missouri Dept. of Transportation (MoDOT), a partner of the Missouri State Library, is also accessible through Arthur. <br />

    <br />

MOBIUS is a state-wide consortium, while Arthur, part of MOBIUS, is a cluster of 6 libraries in the central part of the state.<br />

    <br />

    <p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

    <a name="general3"></a><b>What Is Interlibrary Loan (ILL)?</b><br />

Interlibrary Loan is the service through which libraries borrow and lend resources outside MOBIUS in order to provide patron access to materials not held locally. The rules governing using Interlibrary Loan are different at each library so you should check with your library about what is available to you.<br />

    <br />

    <p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

    <a name="general4"></a><b>What Is the Difference Between MOBIUS, Arthur, and 

    Interlibrary Loan (ILL)?</b><br />

Arthur is a group of six libraries (Columbia College, Lincoln University, the Missouri State Library, Stephens College, Westminster College, and William Woods) that is part of the MOBIUS consortium. Interlibrary Loan is used to obtain material from libraries both in and outside of the state of Missouri that are not part of MOBIUS.<br />

    <br />

    <p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

    <a name="general5"></a> <b>I have an ID I use to check out books, but what is 

    a Location Code?</b><br />

The Location Code is an abbreviation that stands for your institution. In Arthur the codes are: Columbia College - CC, Lincoln University - LU, Missouri State Library - M, Stephens College - SC, Westminster College - WC, William Woods University - WW. You will also find your campus code on the request page.<br />

    <br />

    <p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

    <a name="general6"></a><b>Can I get a book or a photocopied article from another 

    library?</b><br />

Yes, you can borrow books from any MOBIUS member library in person or by requesting the book through the catalog system. You can get books from outside the MOBIUS system by using Interlibrary Loan. While you cannot get photocopied articles from another library through the MOBIUS system, you can get them through Interlibrary Loan. See the sections on MOBIUS and Interlibrary Loan in this FAQ.<br />

    <br />

    <p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

    <a name="general7"></a><b>Where can I get help searching the catalog?</b><br />

If you can't find the answer to your questions in this FAQ, contact a librarian at your library for assistance.<br />

    <br />

    <p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

    <a name="general8"><b>Can I go to another library and use their facilities?</b><br />

    </a> Yes, you can visit any MOBIUS member library, use their facilities and check out books. A list of member libraries is available at <a href="http://mobius.umsystem.edu/screens/libinfo.html">http://mobius.umsystem.edu/screens/libinfo.html</a>. You can find the hours of the library on their home pages. There are a few things to keep in mind before you go:<br />

    <ol>

      <li>Take the card you use to check out materials from your own library. The number you use to check out materials could be your student ID, your social security number, or a specifically assigned library number, it is whatever <i>your</i> library uses. For more information check with your library. If your ID card is not a picture ID take a picture ID with you. </li>

      <li>Check with your home library before you go to make sure your account has all the necessary information. If your account is blocked for overdue books, fines or any other reason, you will need to clear that up before you can check out books at another library. </li>

      <li>Remember your cluster is Arthur and find out what your home library uses for "Campus ID" and make note of your campus code. </li>

      <li>Books are the only items you can check out from another library. Non-book items cannot be checked out from libraries other than your own. Some schools may allow you to use their periodical collections, but may not allow you to use their databases. If you need to use audiovisual equipment or materials, periodicals, databases, or any other non-book items check with the library in question before you go.<br />

      </li>

    </ol>

    <p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

    <a name="general9"><b>Does the online catalog contain full-text journal articles?</b><br />

    </a>No. What you see in the online catalog is a record of the print periodicals any particular library holds in their collection. The record will have information such as the location within the library, the call number, and what issues of that journal the library owns.<br />

    <br />

    <p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

    <a name="general10"><b>Can I get full-text journal articles?</b><br />

    </a>Check with your home library to find out what options you have. If your library does not have the online or print full-text of the article you need, they may be able to get it for you through Interlibrary Loan. Keep in mind that this may be a long process often taking more than two weeks.<br />

    <br />

    <p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

    <a name="general11"><b>How do I renew books?</b></a> 

    <ul>

      <li>Open your web browser to your library’s catalog.</li>

      <li>Follow the link that allows access to your library account.   </li>

      <li>Enter your name and ID number as requested on the form. Remember to add the campus code to your ID number. </li>

      <li>Click the “Submit” button.</li>

      <li>On the next page, click the “Checked Out” button.</li>

      <li>Once your list of items appears, you can choose to renew any or all items by clicking the appropriate boxes to the left and then clicking on the “Renew Marked” button, or you can renew your entire list by clicking the “Renew All” button. </li>


    </ul>

Important note: Not all items are renewable. Check the status of your item(s) after submitting your renewal command. If it renewed successfully a new due date will appear. If not, there will be a message showing the reason. Books from other institutions can take time to renew. Check back after a while to see if the renewal was successful. If you have questions or problems, please call or e-mail the circulation department at your library.<br />

    <a name="search3"><b>How many books can I have out at one time?</b></a> <br />
At the MOBIUS level undergraduates can have 10 books at one time and faculty and graduate students can have 20 books at one time. However, each library has its own limits regarding total items checked out, so you should inquire at your library.<br />

    <br />

    <p align="right"><font size="-2"><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></font></p>

    <a name="search4"><b>How long can I keep books from other libraries?</b></a>

    <br />

    <ol>

      <li><i>Do a subject search instead of a keyword search. </i>Library of Congress (LC) Subject searches cover a standardized list of terms called subject headings. But you must use the exact LC subject headings. Children's subject headings can also be used to search for specialized materials. <br />

      </li>
                                                                
      <li><i>Do a title search instead of a keyword search. </i>Sometimes you can find a handful of books with titles that begin with your topic, e.g. Management. As an alternative, you can type t: in front of a word to search for that word in the title of a work. This should also produce fewer results than a keyword search. Example: t:France finds materials with the word France anywhere in the title. <br />

      </li>                                                          

      <li><i>Use the word "and" to do a keyword search on more than one concept.</i> 

        The catalog will look for items that mention both terms. Example: television and children </li>

      <li><i>Use the word "not" between two terms to omit certain keywords.</i> 

        The computer will look for items that mention the first term but omit any items that mention the second term after the Not. Example: South America not Brazil </li>

      <li><i>When viewing a record for an item you retrieved, check the "Subjects" 

        field to find more specific headings/terms.</i> Scroll down through the record for an item you retrieved until you see the Subject area. Here you will find suggestions for other subject terms you may use. A search on the word training, for example, will yield books on the narrower subjects such as <u>Training of Teams in the Workplace</u>.<br />

      </li>

      <li><i>Use the Limit/Sort button to narrow to a particular publication year 

        or years, material type, language, etc.</i> For example, you can search on World War II and limit the results to videotapes on the topic. </li>

      <li><i>Do a Keyword search instead of a LC Subject, Medical Subject or Children's 

        Subject search.</i> A keyword search covers more fields, such as title, notes, etc.  </li>

      <li><i>Use the word "or" to search on variations of a concept.</i> Using "or" to link two words with the same meaning or two words, either of which would satisfy your needs, will result in a larger number of hits from your search. Example: Amazon or Amazon.com, and another example: Greek or Latin. </li>

      <li><i>Use an asterisk* to truncate endings of words.</i> Search for variations of a word by adding an asterisk. For example, to search for training, trainer, trainers or train, type: train*. </li>

    <a name="search20"><b>I didn't get anything</b><br />

    </a>If your search yields zero results: <br />

    <ol>

      <li>Check your spelling. Unfortunately, the catalog won't do this for you. You can use an asterisk * if you know at least part of a word. Example: "Dostoevsk*" will find Dostoevsky or Dostoevskii. If you want the catalog to fill in more than 5 letters, use two asterisks. Example: "totalit**" for a search on totalitarianism.  </li>

      <li>Make sure you are doing the correct type of search, such as an “Author” search for authors, “Title” for titles and so on, or use a general “Keyword” search.</li>

      <li>Do a simple search using fewer keywords. Limit the number of words you are stringing together with the word “and.” For example, instead of “personnel and training and computer-assisted instruction”, try “computer-assisted instruction and evaluation," or "training and computer-assisted instruction." </li>
